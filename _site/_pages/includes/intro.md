Hello, my name is Haotian Bai(白皓天). I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in computer vision, AI Thrust, at HKUST's Guangzhou campus, supervised by Prof. <a href='https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/people/hui-xiong/'>Hui Xiong(熊辉)</a>.

My primary research interests are in 3D reconstruction, with a focus on Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), and its applications using multi-model data. I am also interested in robotics, specifically simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). 
<!-- Beyond that, my personal research interests include graph theory, complex systems, life science especially aging, physics(thermodynamics),and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). -->
My papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DIy4cA0AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fhbai98%2Fhbai98.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> are accepted at prestigious AI conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, and NeurIPS.
I also serve as reviewers on well known journals including TPAMI, TOMM, and TIP.
Please feel free to comment on [Github ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/hbai98?style=social)](https://github.com/hbai98) for further discussion on my works.

In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, playing basketball, listening to music, and learning about starting a business.

Recently,

- I am investigating on 3D/4D scene reconstruction and generation.

<!-- - I am working with <a href='https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/LI-Haoxiang/haoxiangli'>Prof.Haoxiang Li</a> on <a href='https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Photoemission_spectroscopy'>photoemission spectroscopy</a> for quantum materials.
- I am working with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G1NiRmwAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof.Yize Chen</a> on reinforcement learning with Large Language Model(LLM). -->
<!-- - I am working with Bonan Liu and <a href='https://panhui.people.ust.hk/'>Prof. Pan Hui</a> on 3D vision and robotics. -->
