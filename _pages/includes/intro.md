Hello, my name is Haotian Bai(白皓天). I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in computer vision, AI Thrust, at HKUST's Guangzhou campus. I am a part of <a href='https://vlislab22.github.io/vlislab/'>Vlislab</a> research team, supervised by Prof. <a href='https://vlislab22.github.io/vlislab/linwang.html'>Addison Lin Wang(王林)</a>.

In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, playing basketball, listening to music, and learning about starting a business.

My primary research interests are in 3D reconstruction, with a focus on Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and its applications using multi-model data. I am also interested in robotics, specifically simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Beyond that, my personal research interests include graph theory, complex systems, life science especially aging, physics(thermodynamics),and deep reinforcement learning (DRL).
My papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DIy4cA0AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fhbai98%2Fhbai98.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> are accepted at prestigious AI conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, and NeurIPS.
